# renderer_2d :fireworks:
#### General template for fast rendering with low-level pixel-by-pixel rendering.

## Introduction :v:
This project is a template for rendering 2D graphics.  

The main feature is fast pixel-by-pixel rendering, which is great for creating simulations.

## Small Guide :heavy_check_mark:

#### ðŸ”¸ Change the color of a pixel
> All you need to know to use this template productively is how graphics are rendered.  
> Essentially, we have a **one-dimensional integer array** containing the **RGB values of each pixel**.  
> Accordingly, by changing the values of this array, we change the color of the pixel on the screen.  
> Below is a small example (really small).
```java
pixelBuffer[0] = 0x000000; // BLACK
```

## Conclusion :hatched_chick:
You have questions?  

Well, I think in the `Main.java` file you can easily figure out what's what thanks to the comments.

See you later!
